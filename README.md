# Football-Player-Searcher
This is a project for my CSE 385 (Database Systems) course at Miami University (OH). This program consists of a SQL database and Java UI. The user will be able to search for a player by first and last name, and the program will return this player's name, position, team name, market value in euros, and their team's average market value in euros.
