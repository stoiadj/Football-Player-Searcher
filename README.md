# Football Player Searcher Application
This is a project for my CSE 385 (Database Systems) course at Miami University (OH). This program consists of a SQL database and Java UI. The user will be able to search for a player by first and last name, and the program will return this player's name, position, team name, market value in euros, and their team's average market value in euros.

The CSE Project Documentation file showcases instructions on how to run the program and application.

Here is an image of the application:
